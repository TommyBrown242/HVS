# HVS
Hardware Vulnerability Scanner

This is an application designed to allow the user to scan their machine and see if any of the components have any known CVE
vulnerabiities.
Any vulnerabilities found are presented to the user along with a warning of their severity.

The frontend and backend can both be found in the HardwareVulnerabilityScanner.java file. The frontend was developed using JavaFX and the backend using API calls to the NIST vulnerability database to search for relevant CVE vulnerabilities.
